# Abstract

With the immense popularity of ride sharing services, more and more people use services like Uber. It is an online marketplace for riders and drivers. Normally a rider uses his smartphone app to request rides. Ride requests are assigned to a Uber driver, who uses his own vehicle to provide the ride. Low cost, short waiting time, availability as well as the convenience of simplified ride requests and easy payment are considered the main reasons of Uber’s popularity among the riders. On the other hand, the flexibility of work schedule, higher compensation rates and independence attract a lot of part time and full time drivers to contract with Uber. Students, professional drivers or people in-between jobs share their ride to earn some extra cash. As an independent worker, a driver would always want to fill the car with passengers to maximize profit. But it is not always easy to find a rider. Especially for a new driver in a new city. We analyzed Uber historic data in New York city and built a web application. Based on the holiday or workday and different times of the day, we suggest a location to the driver which is not very far away from the current location and has the higher probability of getting a ride.

## 1.1 Introduction
Now-a-days a large number of people use ridesharing services like Uber, Lyft. According to Uber, their service is available in 900 cities, across 93 countries.

Uber, founded in 2009, is one of the most successful ridesharing companies. It is an online marketplace for riders and drivers. Normally. a rider uses his smartphone Uber app to request a ride. The ride requests are assigned to a specific Uber driver who uses his own vehicle to provide the ride. Low cost, short waiting time, availability as well as the convenience of simplified ride requests and easy payment are the main reasons contributing to Uber’s popularity among the riders. On the other hand, the flexibility of work schedule, higher compensation rates and independence are among the main reasons making Uber popular with drivers.

Independence of work attracts a lot of part time and full time drivers to contract with Uber. Students, professional drivers or people in-between jobs share their ride to earn some extra cash. As an independent worker, a driver would always want to fill the car with passengers to maximize profit.  But it is not always easy to find a rider. Especially for a new driver in a new city. We analyzed Uber historic data in New York city and built a web application. We suggest a place to the driver to be where he can find a rider.

## 1.2 Motivation
A rider requests a ride using Uber App. A nearby Uber driver can accept the request and complete the ride. In order to accept the ride request a driver has to be in a certain radius of the rider when the rider requests the ride. If the driver is far away, he won’t be able to accept the ride request. And if a driver doesn’t get a request, he has to stay idle or roam around randomly.
